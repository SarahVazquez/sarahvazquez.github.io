                 <h5> Play video games <h5>
             <p>   I grew up playing video games and it is a big part of my life.  I remember when I was young, I would always
                  want to play with my brother whenever he was playing his video games.  I looked up to my older brother alot 
                  back then and I still do now.  I still play video games but mostly on my Xbox One.  I do have other gaming
                  systems but that is the one I play on most. I also mostly play first person shooters such as Halo, Gears of War,etc.
                  But overall I play a variety of different games.  My gamertag is FlawlessV1CT0RY and you can view my xbox 
                  profile here: <a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Profile?GamerTag=FlawlessV1CT0RY"> linked text </a></p>
              
                   
                
                  <h6>. Listen to music<h6>
                <p>     I absolutely love to listen to music!  I love rock, classic rock, and some pop.  My favorite band
                      is Coldplay. Some day I would really love to see them in concert!  I am also pretty open to all kinds 
                      of music.  It really calms me down and takes some of the stress away.

     <h4> My Dream Place <h5>
     <u2>  
      <li> The one spot that I would want to vist the most in the world is Iceland.  The reason is because I want to see the Northern Lights. 
       I've wanted to see them ever since I was little but I still have yet to go. I've never been outside of the United States and I 
       want my first time to be Iceland.

      <li> Other than that, I also want to vist Spain.  I think the culture is rich and I hear they take naps in the middle of
       the day so that is definately for me.

                <center> <h3> <font color="Blue">Play video games </font> <center>
           <right>  <p>   I grew up playing video games and it is a big part of my life.  I remember when I was young, I would always
                  want to play with my brother whenever he was playing his video games.  I looked up to my older brother alot 
                  back then and I still do now.  I still play video games but mostly on my Xbox One.  I do have other gaming
                  systems but that is the one I play on most. I also mostly play first person shooters such as Halo, Gears of War,etc.
                  But overall I play a variety of different games.  My gamertag is <font color="red">FlawlessV1CT0RY</font> and if you have xbox live,
                  you can sign in and view my xbox profile <a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Profile?GamerTag=FlawlessV1CT0RY"> Here</a></p></right>
              
                   
                
                  <center><h3> <font color="Cyan">Listen to music</font><h3> <center>
                <p>     I absolutely love to listen to music!  I love rock, classic rock, and some pop.  My favorite band
                      is Coldplay. Some day I would really love to see them in concert!  I am also pretty open to all kinds 
                      of music.  It really calms me down and takes some of the stress away.
                  
                  <center> <h3> <font color="Purple">Play Volleyball</font><h3> <center>
                <p> My favorite sport to play is Volleyball.  I use to play when I was in middle school.  I was the captain,
                  MVP, and all-star of my team (not to brag or anything).  I enjoyed playing for my schools team very much.
                  I even wanted to pursue it in high school, but unfortunately my school did not have an offical 
                  Volleyball team. I considered trying out for the team at UB, but I think im too rusty and not good enough
                  to make the team.  Plus I really want to focus on my school work since it is my first semester.
                    
                 <center> <h3><font color="Orange">Hang out with friends and family</font> <h3> <center>
                    <p> I have a very small group of friends that I hang out with and I dont mind it at all. I am alittle on 
                      the antisocial side so it is sometimes hard for me to make new friends, but when I do its great.  My 
                      friends and I often just like to get together and play games, whether it is video games or board games.  
                      We watch movies together and just have loads of fun.  When it comes to my family, well... they are amazing.
                      They always support me in everything that I do.  My mothers is loving and warm and really, I mean REALLY,
                      knows how to cook.  I miss her cooking alot actually.  My dad and brother both love playing video games.  
                      They even stream themselves playing so that they can help others.  They mostly play a video game called
                      Destiny on the PS4.  If interested, the link to my brothers twitch account is <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/littlefoot_tv"> Here</a></p>
                      I also have a lovely and sweet grandmother and two amazing dogs named Lucy and Gimli (Yes we got the name
                      Gimli from the Lord and the Rings). 
                    Here are some pictures of Gimli:

     <h3><font color="Pink">My Dream Place</font>  <h3>
     <u2>  
      <li> <p>The one spot that I would want to vist the most in the world is Iceland.  The reason is because I want to see the Northern Lights. 
       I've wanted to see them ever since I was little but I still have yet to go. I've never been outside of the United States and I 
        want my first time to be Iceland.</p>
       
   <li> <img src="img_lights.jpg" style="width:300px;height:300px;" align="center">

       
      <li> <p>Other than that, I also want to vist Spain.  I think the culture is rich and I hear they take naps in the middle of
        the day so that is definately for me.</p>
